After obtaining his Fellowship with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons he completed the two year ANZHPBA post-fellowship program in HPB surgery followed by a further two year surgical oncology and abdominal transplantation Fellowship at the University of Toronto.

He has a special interest in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery with a broad experience of laparoscopic surgery and developing robotic surgery. Outside of oncology, he manages benign biliary disease including the laparoscopic management of bile duct stones and the surgical management of acute and chronic pancreatitis. 

Recently completing his Master's degree in Biostatistics, he has published on the use of Propensity Scores and novel weighting techniques in observational surgical research. He is active in teaching medical students and trainees, and maintains a strong interest in clinical and translational research.
